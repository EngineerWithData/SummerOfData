# EngineerWithData 
## Summer of Data

Organization + Mentors + Mentees => Data Project Team

Steps:

* Define a **Data Project**
* Work on the **Data Project** in the Summer
* Write a **Data Project** Report
* Present the **Data Project** at the end of the Summer

The focus of a **Data Project** should be on engineering data.  Examples include building databases or training predictive models or building tools or studying correlation and trends, anything to support the advancement and accessibility of engineering data models.

All work is open-source and open-access.   

A **Data Project** stipend is provided by the sponsoring Organization.   Half of the stipend goes to the **ProjectTeam** and half of the stipend goes to **EngineerWithData** to support its growth and programs.

Projects will be presented at an **EngineerWithData** gathering at the end of the Summer.

An **Organization** can be a company or a university.

This **Summer of Data** program is inspired by [Google's SoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
